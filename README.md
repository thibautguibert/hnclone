Please create the front page of Hacker News. A screenshot of the design is in the attachment.How the application should look like:

·        To be written in React

·        To connect to the Hacker News API

·        To display a list of the 20 most popular posts on Hacker News

·        To display the next 20 posts when clicking on the "more" link at the bottom of the list

·        To automatically refresh the list of posts every 30 seconds

·        To refresh the list by pressing the refresh button

What we most look for:

·        Does the application work

·        Application structure

·        Components

·        Code organization.

 

What not to waste time on:

·        Redux, you can use it if you want, but even if you omit it is not crucial to the test.
